- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aarathi (@rtparam)
-    I'm a physics grad student at Uni Bonn.
-    This contains most of my codes from school work/other projects I've done (with a little context)
-    My primary interests are in complex systems and nonlinear dynamics but here you'll find projects in multiple fields like particle physics, quantum computing, computational neuroscience, astronomy, etc.
